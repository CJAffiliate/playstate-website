Rebuild the current "Our Services" section as a modern, 3-card visual layout inspired by the reference screenshot provided.

Each card should feature a full-width image background with a dark overlay, white clear titles, short supporting descriptions, and tag-style service labels. This section must be fully mobile-responsive: stack vertically on mobile, 3-column grid on desktop.

Background image with object-fit: cover
