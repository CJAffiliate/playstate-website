✅ 1. Create Rhythm with Alternating Layouts
🔄 Alternate left/right layouts for each client file instead of stacking all text left + image right.

File 1 → Text Left, Image Right

File 2 → Image Left, Text Right

File 3 → Text Left, Image Right

This breaks repetition and gives a modern visual rhythm.

✅ 2. Improve Visual Hierarchy
Right now everything looks flat. Fix this by:

Increasing section padding/margins (let each file breathe).

Give each file a strong top label/header:

📂 FILE 01 — Trade AI in bold, uppercase, with a yellow tab/icon

Use font scaling: make the client name 1–2 sizes larger than subheaders.

Add thin dividers or file borders to clearly segment each case.

✅ 3. Use Unique Visuals per Project
Currently all projects use the same image (a Trade AI mobile screen). That kills trust and credibility.

Even if it's placeholder for now, give each project a different screenshot, mockup, or blurred frame to suggest real output.

✅ 4. Add Accent Elements for ‘File’ Vibe
Right now the page says “files” but visually just shows boring blocks. Add subtle file-themed UI:

A yellow folder tab peeking out of the top-left corner of each file block.

Add “Status: File Complete” in the top-right in digital font or label badge.

Consider light horizontal lines, faux timestamps, or folder icons in corners.

✅ 5. Use Transitions and Scroll Effects
Everything appears static. Add:

Soft fade-in or slide-in for each file.

Hover effect on “Open Full File” CTA: background glow or file icon slide-in.

Light parallax on the screenshot image to give some visual depth.

✅ 6. Shrink to 3 Files Max
Right now 4 still feels like too many for the design to handle.

Use your 3 best projects.

This will allow:

More spacing

Better storytelling per file

The CTA at the bottom (“Submit Your Brand Brief”) to feel intentional

✅ 7. Final CTA Redesign
Make the bottom CTA feel more like the next logical “file to open.”

Line above:

“Your brand could be the next mission file.”

Button:

Submit Your Brand Brief →

Use a folder or upload icon next to the text.

Make it pop with yellow border and animated hover effect.

✍️ Optional Tone Upgrade
Consider renaming sections inside each file to align with the covert dossier theme:

It ties in better with “Client File” and gives each project more narrative personality.
