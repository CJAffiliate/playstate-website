Add a thin, animated ticker to the bottom of the PLAYSTATE site labeled “PLAYSTATE Live Project Feed”. This strip should feel like a real-time agency activity feed, cycling through short, clever, action-based updates like a terminal or stock ticker.

Must be fully responsive, fixed to the bottom of the viewport, and unobtrusive but stylish.

✅ STRUCTURE
Position: Fixed to the bottom of the viewport, above or inside the footer

Height: 30–40px max height on desktop and mobile

Scroll Type: Continuous left-to-right scroll loop

Label: On the left:

🟡 PLAYSTATE LIVE PROJECT FEED

Ticker Content: Scrolling horizontally through punchy “project update” blurbs

🎨 STYLING

Element	Style
Background	#0e0e0e (dark) or darker gradient to match site theme
Text Color	White or light gray (#ffffff / #dddddd)
Highlight Icons	Use select emojis or animated SVGs (e.g., 🚀 📈 🧠 ✅)
Ticker Speed	Medium-fast, readable pace (animation-duration: 30–45s)
Padding	Small vertical padding (8–10px), some horizontal breathing room
⚙️ TECHNICAL NOTES
Use a <marquee>-style effect via CSS keyframes or JS loop (not actual <marquee> tag)

Animate inside a div that loops its contents for infinite scroll

Allow ticker to pause on hover for accessibility

Use z-index high enough to not be covered by the footer

✅ RESPONSIVE CONSIDERATIONS
On mobile, shrink font slightly (use 14px instead of 16px)

Ensure label stays fixed and legible next to ticker line

Optionally hide or simplify emojis/icons on very small screens

🧠 OPTIONAL EXTRAS
Add a faint pulse or flicker effect to the “LIVE PROJECT FEED” label

Use a blinking dot or typing cursor next to it (● _)

Make the ticker collapsible or closable if you want UX flexibility
