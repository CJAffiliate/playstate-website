Rebuild the Projects page and update the Home page project preview section to better showcase each client project visually and dynamically.

Use a floating phone mockup UI for each project, displaying screenshots or content related to the project (e.g., landing pages, ads, email flows). Add an auto-rotating feature on the homepage to cycle through multiple projects with different visuals. Also update the brand section accordingly.

✅ SECTION 1 — Homepage “Our Work” / Project Preview
Goal: Show rotating featured projects (one at a time) using a floating phone mockup that updates automatically every few seconds.

Instructions:

Use a centered floating phone frame (like current Trade IQ example), but allow it to rotate between multiple projects

Each “slide” includes:

Phone screen content (screenshot of asset: site, ad, or email)

Short 2–3 line case summary

Label: Client/project name (e.g., TRADE AI, GREENHOMEPATH)

Optional tag: Landing Page, Funnel, Ad Bundle

Rotate automatically every 6–8 seconds using JavaScript

Include manual navigation dots or arrows to allow user control

Example Project #1: TRADE AI
Image: Landing page or funnel screenshot

Text:

Helped secure £250,000 in funding by designing a high-conversion funnel and waitlist system for an AI-powered trading app.

Example Project #2: GREENHOMEPATH
Image: Screenshot of the lead capture landing page

Text:

Built a lead-gen system for a pay-per-lead affiliate brand in the green energy space. Targeted cost-conscious homeowners via Facebook & Instagram ads and funneled leads to HVAC companies.

✅ SECTION 2 — Projects Page Overhaul
Goal: Visually showcase all projects using a consistent floating mobile device UI that reflects the actual asset delivered.

Instructions:

For each project:

Display a phone frame or device mockup (floating or lightly shadowed)

On the phone screen, show:

A live preview or image of what PLAYSTATE delivered (landing page, email flow, ad creative, dashboard, etc.)

Below or beside the phone, add:

Project title

Short paragraph (problem → what PLAYSTATE did → outcome)

CTA: “View Project File” or “Open Breakdown”

Stack these vertically with 100px+ space between each for a clean scroll

✅ SECTION 3 — Update "Brands We've Helped Build"
Instructions:

Replace the Airbnb logo in the “Brands We’ve Helped Build” section with the GreenHomePath logo

Use a monochrome version (gray or white) to match styling of the other logos

Apply the same hover effect (brightness or fade-in glow)

✨ BONUS VISUAL REFINEMENTS
Add subtle background elements to the Projects section (blueprint lines, floating UI elements, or tech-style grid)

Phone screens should animate slightly or pulse on load (parallax tilt or subtle floating motion)

On mobile, make sure phone mockups stack vertically with text and CTA beneath
