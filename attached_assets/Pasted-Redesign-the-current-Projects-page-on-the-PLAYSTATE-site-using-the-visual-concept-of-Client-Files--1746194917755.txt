Redesign the current Projects page on the PLAYSTATE site using the visual concept of “Client Files.”
Instead of the current grid or card layout, each project should now be displayed like a modern digital case file—a stylized, classified document or mission dossier that showcases the work we’ve done in a clean, structured, and slightly cinematic way.

Here’s exactly how to structure and style the new version:

🧱 OVERALL STRUCTURE:
Layout: Vertical stack of 3–5 full-width "Client File" blocks, each representing a case study.

Each file should have its own clear container (light border, subtle paper/folder visual cue, or shadow to differentiate it).

The page should still feel modern and minimal—use dark background, white/yellow text accents, and clear spacing.

📄 EACH CLIENT FILE INCLUDES:
Top Row - File Header:

Styled like a digital document header with:

Client Name (e.g., “TRADE AI”)

Project Type Tag (e.g., “Landing Page”)

A small badge: STATUS: FILE COMPLETE

Optional file number: FILE 01

Problem → Solution → Result Section:

Use labeled subheadings:

❓ The Challenge: Brief sentence describing the issue.

⚒️ The Build: What PLAYSTATE did to solve it.

🎯 The Result: Quantified result or client win.

Asset Preview / Visual:

Display a medium-sized screenshot of the work delivered (landing page, ad, etc.)

The image should appear embedded within the file, like a photo attached to a case report.

CTA Button (bottom of each file):

“Open Full File” or “View Case Breakdown”

Optional: Add subtle hover animation to feel like clicking into a deeper report.

✨ VISUAL STYLE:
Typography: Use clean sans-serif fonts (e.g., Inter or Space Grotesk). Section headers can mimic a terminal or dossier label style (uppercase, monospace optional).

Color Theme:

Background: #0e0e0e (dark)

Accents: #FFD300 (yellow), #FFFFFF (white text), #aaaaaa for labels

Card Styling:

Each client file box has a light outline or shadow, maybe a thin yellow top border like a folder tab.

Animate in with a fade-up scroll animation for each file.

Hover Effects: Slight glow or scale on hover for CTAs or images.

📍 FOOTER OR FINAL CTA:
At the bottom of the page, include a centered CTA:

“Your brand could be the next case file.”
[Start Your Project]

And ensure the floating 'Let’s Talk' inquiry button remains visible throughout.
