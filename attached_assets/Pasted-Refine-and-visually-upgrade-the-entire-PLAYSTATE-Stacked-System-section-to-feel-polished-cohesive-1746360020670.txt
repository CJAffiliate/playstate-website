Refine and visually upgrade the entire “PLAYSTATE Stacked System” section to feel polished, cohesive, and optimized across all screen sizes. This includes both the 4-step system layout and the System Output metrics beneath it, which should be treated as a continuation — not a separate section.

TITLE DESIGN:

Redesign the section title to visually reflect the stacked nature of the system:

Place the word “Stacked” directly above the word “System” in a clean stacked formation

Use slightly different font weights, sizes, or coloring to differentiate the two words while keeping them unified

Centered layout preferred for balance

STACKED SYSTEM BLOCK (Top Half):

Ensure all 4 steps (Diagnose, Build, Launch, Optimize & Scale) are:

Horizontally aligned on desktop with equal spacing

Displayed side-by-side on mobile, using a responsive row or scrollable container (not stacked vertically)

Each step should be styled as a modular card with:

Icon at top

Title

One-line description

Clean padding and spacing inside the card

Slight hover animation (e.g. glow or float)

Add a subtle dark glow or grid background layer behind the entire system block to visually anchor it

SYSTEM OUTPUT BLOCK (Bottom Half):

Visually connect this to the system block — remove any hard dividers or contrasting backgrounds

Treat this as a continuation of the system section, representing the real-world output of that process

Show the 3 key metrics side-by-side even on mobile:

Either use a compressed 3-column responsive layout or enable horizontal scroll for clean side-by-side layout

Metric layout should include:

A bold number (animated counter on scroll if possible)

A short metric title (e.g. “ROI on Marketing Spend”)

Light explanatory subtext

Optional icon next to each metric

Apply card-style visuals with matching styles to the 4 system steps for visual consistency

VISUAL CONTINUITY & POLISH:

Maintain consistent vertical spacing so the whole section flows smoothly without large gaps

Add a visual indicator that connects the top system to the bottom output (e.g. a flowing line or fade-down background)

Make sure all text is legible in dark mode and spacing adapts gracefully to smaller screens

BONUS:

If possible, animate the section slightly as it enters view — subtle staggered fade-in or upward movement of each block/card
