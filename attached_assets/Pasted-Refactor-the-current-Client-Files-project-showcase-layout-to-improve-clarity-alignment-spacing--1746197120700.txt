Refactor the current “Client Files” project showcase layout to improve clarity, alignment, spacing, and presentation. Keep the classified/mission-file theme, but remove the overlapping and visual noise. Here's exactly how to fix it:

✅ 1. Remove the Overlap
Get rid of the floating/stacked card overlap effect currently used.

Instead, display each “file” as its own standalone card, aligned in a clean vertical stack with proper spacing (at least 80–100px between cards).

Cards can animate in on scroll, but should not float, stack, or obscure each other.

✅ 2. Only Show One Case Study Per File
Right now, the Trade AI card contains two projects inside it. That’s confusing.

Each Client File = one clear project.

Trade AI (File 01)

FreshDrip (File 02)

GrowGuru (File 03)

Do not mix two brands inside one card.

✅ 3. Standardize Layout of Each Card
Each card should include:

File Header

“FILE 01 — TRADE AI”

Top-right label: STATUS: FILE COMPLETE

Project type tag (e.g., Landing Page)

Text Content

❓ Objective

⚙️ Action Taken

🎯 Outcome

Visual

1 image of the asset delivered (clean, scaled, ideally different per project)

Place to the right or underneath the text depending on screen size

CTA

“Open File” button at bottom of card

Cards should be styled like clean, digital folders or dossiers.

✅ 4. Improve Mobile Responsiveness
On smaller screens:

Stack image under the text content

Reduce padding, but preserve breathing room

Make sure buttons don’t wrap or overlap

✅ 5. Tone/Hierarchy Cleanup
Make the Client name bold and prominent.

Use consistent font sizing for Objective / Action / Outcome.

Highlight the result in yellow (e.g., “+27% conversion”)

Remove placeholder text like “project preview” from image boxes. Use real or varied visuals.

✅ 6. Adjust Footer CTA Positioning
Move the "Submit Your Brand Brief" CTA slightly higher, just after the last file.

Ensure it has extra top/bottom margin so it doesn’t feel glued to the last card or footer.

Optionally add:

“Your brand could be File 04.”
Above the button.
