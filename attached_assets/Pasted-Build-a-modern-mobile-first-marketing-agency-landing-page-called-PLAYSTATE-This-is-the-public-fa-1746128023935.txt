Build a modern, mobile-first marketing agency landing page called “PLAYSTATE.”
This is the public-facing site of a design-forward marketing agency. The site must be responsive, fast-loading, and visually engaging with smooth, professional animations that add depth and interactivity without clutter. The color palette is yellow, black, and white, inspired by retro-arcade visuals but designed with modern web minimalism in mind.

🟡 GENERAL STYLING + LAYOUT
Font: Use a clean, modern sans-serif font like Inter, Space Grotesk, or Satoshi.

Color Scheme:

Background: #0e0e0e (deep black)

Accent: #FFD300 (bright yellow)

Secondary text: #ffffff and muted greys like #aaaaaa

Theme: Professional but animated. Think: creative studio that actually converts.

Animation style: Soft scroll reveals, hover effects, floating elements, icon pulses, maybe parallax on larger screens.

🎮 HERO SECTION
Large “PLAYSTATE” wordmark in glowing 8-bit font style centered on screen. Use pixel-style type, animated glow with CSS, maybe even subtle “scanline” effects in background.

Background is black with floating yellow & white marketing icons (ads, emails, megaphones, cursor clicks, landing pages) that subtly float or pulse around the logo.

Under logo: Add tagline in clean font (adjustable later), like:

"Custom-built marketing. From pixels to profits."

Add a large CTA button:
[Work With Us] → triggers a modal or pop-up inquiry form (always accessible from anywhere on the site too).

📦 OFFER SECTION (Immediately below hero)
Design 3 compact cards, side-by-side on desktop and stacked on mobile. Each should have an icon, a punchy name, short description, and a “Get Started” or “Learn More” link.

🧱 LOGO TRUST SECTION

Display 4–6 greyed-out logos of real or mock companies you've worked with (editable).

Use low-opacity greyscale and optionally animate on hover (subtle reveal).

🔁 FLOATING INQUIRY FORM

On click, triggers a slide-up or modal-style form:

Message box: “What are you trying to fix/build?”

Submission confirmation message: “Got it. We’ll get back to you with next steps.”
