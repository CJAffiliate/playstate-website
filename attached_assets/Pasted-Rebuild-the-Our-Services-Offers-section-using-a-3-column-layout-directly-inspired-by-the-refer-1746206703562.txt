Rebuild the “Our Services” / “Offers” section using a 3-column layout directly inspired by the reference screenshot provided.

Each offer should appear as a full-width visual card with:

A background image related to the service

A solid overlay gradient or blur layer for legibility

Large title at top-left

Short description beneath

A row of service tags or keywords at the bottom

The layout should be fully responsive, stacking vertically on mobile with all text and image ratios preserved.
